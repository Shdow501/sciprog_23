In this practical we create a fucntion to calculate the taylor series. We use the malloc function for dynamically allocating memory. From the results we can see that the difference in value goes up as the number of terms goes up. This is due to the error in precision which adds up as the number of terms increases.

We can compile the code using the command gcc taylor.c -o taylor -lm and once the executable has been created, we can run it using the command ./taylor
