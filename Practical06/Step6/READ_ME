In this folder we are using multiple files to run the same program of matrix multiplication. We do this to keep the files cleaner and easier readability. Here we also use the make file to compile all the files in a easier fashion so that we don't have to use multiple compilation codes again and again when we make any chages to the code. We can compile it by using the command "make" and then run the executable created by it for the output of the code.
