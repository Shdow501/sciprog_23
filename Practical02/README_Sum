This is part of the week 2 practicals. We can compile the source code using the command "gcc Sum.c -o sum". Once the code is compiled, we can run the executable code using the command "./sum". The reason behind the difference between sum1 and sum2 is because how many bits of data are stored in them. So when the rounding happens, the small changes add up and result in the difference.
