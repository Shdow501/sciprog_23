In this week's practical we take input from a separate file and also learn the use of header files. We take input of a matrix and find if it is a magic square or not. We just need to compile the main code as the calculation code is connected to it.
We can compile the code using the command "gcc main.c" and once the output file has been created we can use the command "./a.out" to run the executable. While executing, the file will ask for the input file containing the matrix and we can provide either the magic_square.txt or the not_magic_square.txt file.
